# Design Document Templates Repository

This repo contains professional templates for common software engineering documents in both **English** and **Spanish**. 

---

## Tools and Formats

- Templates are provided in **Markdown** format (`.md`) for easy editing and compatibility with GitHub, GitLab, and other version control systems.
- You can convert these templates to **PDF** or **Word** using tools like [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) or your favorite Markdown editor.
- For large projects, consider modularizing the documents with tools that support includes (e.g., Pandoc, MkDocs).
- Also, I recommend this awesome markdown project as alternative to LaTeX for technical documentation:
